# This Brewfile is opinionated in the sense that its order/comments do not
# exactly match the output of `brew bundle dump`
#
# Homebrew recommends against hand editing Brewfiles, advising using
# `brew bundle dump` to generate your brewfile

# I like to add comments, set options & reorder things for my own understanding.
